#usage:
#lat filename. sessionName
#
#where: 
# * "filename." EXCLUDES the "tex" extension, i.e. for file1.tex, just use file1
#   this is because tabbing for a tex file name usually stops at "filename.", as
#   there are other files with the same name but different extensions,e.g. file1.aux
#
# * "sessionName" is an optional string. 
#   If this argument is omitted, then "latexdev" will be used



#check if the second command line argument is null or not (saved in $mysession)
mysession=$2
if [ -z "$mysession" ]
then
    #if empty used the session name "latexdev"
    mysession="latexdev"
fi

#check if this session exists
tmux has-session -t "$mysession"
if [ $? != 0 ]
then
    #if session does not exist, then create...
    tmux new-session -s "$mysession" -n editor -d
    
    #...and open filename.tex ...
    #want to open "filename." as "filename.tex", using autocomplete
    tmux send-keys "vim $1tex" C-m

    #...and attach session
    tmux attach -t $mysession
else
    #if the session already exists (with that name) then just print
    #an error message to screen
